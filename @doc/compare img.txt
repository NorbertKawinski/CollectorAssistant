- TinEye
- Google image search

	* (WE WANT TO COMPARE) perceptual similarity as opposed to content-based similarity (https://up.kawinski.net/firefox_2020-10-13_18-36-20.png)
	* Focused(?) on searching many (billions) images quickly
	* Works by generating image signatures (https://up.kawinski.net/firefox_2020-10-13_18-39-13.png)
	* Difference/similarity is a vector difference from the signature (https://up.kawinski.net/firefox_2020-10-13_18-41-13.png)
	* Robust against a *small*: light change, cropping, rotation (up to 3 degrees), modifications

Patrz tylko tą konkretną odpowiedź.
	Fajny pomysł na połączenie kilku metod

	Dunno, może tu coś jest fajnego

(BAD) compare_ssim - The Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) is a perceptual metric that quantifies the image quality degradation 
	that is caused by processing such as data compression or by losses in data transmission. 
	This metric is basically a full reference that requires 2 images from the same shot, this means 2 graphically identical images to the human eye. 
	The second image generally is compressed or has a different quality, which is the goal of this index
